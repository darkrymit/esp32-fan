# System Overall Description {#overall}

## Product Overview
The Cooling Fan Controller project aims to regulate the speed of a cooling fan based on temperature readings from a sensor. The system is built using the Arduino framework on the ESP32 microcontroller, utilizing PWM signals for fan control. The primary goal is to maintain a desired temperature range dynamically.

## Product Functions
- Use PWM signals to adjust the cooling fan speed.
- Read temperature data from a connected sensor.
- Dynamically control fan speed to maintain the desired temperature range.
- Provide logging and debugging information via a serial monitor.

## Constraints

**Implementation restrictions**
- Must be developed using the Arduino framework and deployed on the ESP32 microcontroller.
- The system should use a 5V/12V PWM fan and DHT11/DHT22 temperature sensor.
- Use PlatformIO as the development environment.

**Resource limits**
- Limited processing power and memory of the ESP32 microcontroller.
- Dependence on external power supply for the cooling fan.

**Data limits**
- Temperature data limited by the accuracy and range of the DHT11/DHT22 sensor.

## Assumption and Dependencies
- The project assumes availability of a stable 5V/12V power supply for the cooling fan.
- The system is dependent on the Arduino framework, ESP32 microcontroller, and PlatformIO extension for development and deployment.
- Wokwi simulator is optional but recommended for simulation and testing purposes.
